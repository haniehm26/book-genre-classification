# Book Genre Classification Using Covers and Metadata

## Project Description
This project aims to classify book genres by combining cover images with metadata such as titles and descriptions using multimodal neural networks. By training a joint model that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image processing and text embeddings for metadata analysis, the system is able to predict the genre of a book based on both visual and textual features.

This project was developed as the final project for the **Fundamentals of Data Science** course at **Sapienza University**.


## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (for neural network modeling)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting)
- **Plotly** (for visualizations)
- **Selenium** (for web scraping)
- **Other libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.
